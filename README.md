## Title: Exploring Sentence Length Bias in Cook County Sentencing Data

## Authors: Adin McAuliffe, Jordan Miller, Sam Winchester, Sam O'Donnell 

## Description: 

This is the QSS20 Final Project Repository for Adin McAuliffe, Jordan Miller, Sam Winchester, Sam O'Donnell. In this project we use Cook County Sentencing Data to examine judicial biases in regards to race and gender. We examine how judges sentencing lengths vary based on race, gender, age and location and look at how these variations/disparities change over time.
