To\\n    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be\\n    controlled by setting those parameter values.\\n    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,\\n    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,\\n    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement\\n    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the\\n    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during\\n    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.\\n    The default value ``max_features=\"auto\"`` uses ``n_features``\\n    rather than ``n_features / 3``. The latter was originally suggested in\\n    [1], whereas the former was more recently justified empirically in [2].\\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    .. [1] L.
